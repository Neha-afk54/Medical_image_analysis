----------Medical Image Analysis for Tissue Characterization----------

This project implements a Python-based image processing pipeline to preprocess and analyze biomedical images. 
The workflow includes noise reduction, image segmentation, feature extraction, and visualization to study 
tissue morphology from microscopy-based images.

-----------Tools & Technologies----------------------
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image

-------------Methodology------------------------------
1. Load and preprocess grayscale biomedical images.
2. Apply Gaussian filtering for noise reduction.
3. Perform image segmentation using Otsu’s thresholding.
4. Extract morphological features such as area, perimeter, and mean intensity.
5. Visualize intermediate and final results for interpretability.

--------------Results-------------------------------
The project successfully segments tissue regions and extracts quantitative features that help characterize 
structural properties of biomedical images.
